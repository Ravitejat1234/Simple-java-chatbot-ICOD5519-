# Java Chatbot Documentation

## 1. Introduction
The Java Chatbot is a conversational agent developed in Java programming language. It employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses, aiming to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users.

## 2. Requirements
To run the Java Chatbot program successfully, ensure the following requirements are met:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (recommended JDK version 8 or higher)
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional but recommended for ease of development)
- Basic understanding of Java programming language concepts such as classes, methods, loops, and conditional statements
- Familiarity with natural language processing (NLP) concepts would be beneficial for extending the chatbot's capabilities

## 3. Code Explanation
### 3.1. Import Statements
java
import java.util.Scanner;

The import java.util.Scanner; statement imports the Scanner class from the java.util package. This class is used to read input from the user during the chatbot conversation.

### 3.2. Main Class (Chatbot)
java
public class Chatbot {
    // Main method and other components are here
}

The Chatbot class is the main class of the program, encapsulating the chatbot's functionality and behavior.

### 3.3. Main Method
java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Main logic for chatbot execution
}

The main method serves as the entry point of the program. It initializes essential components and starts the conversation loop.

### 3.4. Scanner Initialization
java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

A Scanner object named scanner is created to read user input from the standard input stream (System.in).

### 3.5. Greeting Message
java
System.out.println("Hello! I am a Java chatbot. How can I assist you today?");

A greeting message is displayed to welcome the user and initiate the conversation.

### 3.6. User Input Loop
java
while (true) {
    // Logic to process user input and generate responses
}

An infinite while loop is used to continuously accept user input and provide responses until the user decides to exit the conversation.

### 3.7. Response Generation
java
String response = getResponse(input);
System.out.println(response);

The getResponse method is called to generate a response based on the user's input. The response is then printed to the console.

### 3.8. Exit Check
java
if (input.equals("exit")) {
    // Exit message and break statement
}

The program checks if the user wants to exit the conversation by typing "exit." If so, a farewell message is displayed, and the loop is terminated.

### 3.9. Scanner Closing
java
scanner.close();

After the conversation ends (user exits), the Scanner object is closed to release system resources.

### 3.10. getResponse Method
java
public static String getResponse(String input) {
    // Logic to generate responses based on user input
}

The getResponse method contains logic to analyze the user's input and generate appropriate responses accordingly.

## 4. Execution Instructions
Follow these steps to compile and run the Java Chatbot program:
1. Open your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
2. Create a new Java project and add the Chatbot.java file to the project.
3. Compile the program within the IDE or using the command line with javac Chatbot.java.
4. Run the compiled program within the IDE or using the command line with java Chatbot.
5. The chatbot will start, display a greeting message, and await user input.

## 5. User Interactions
Below are sample interactions between the user and the Java Chatbot:

User: Hello
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you?

User: What is Java?
Chatbot: Java is a popular programming language.

User: How are you?
Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but thanks for asking!

User: Bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Take care.


## 6. Conclusion
The Java Chatbot program provides a foundational framework for creating a conversational agent in Java. It demonstrates the integration
of user input processing, response generation, and conversation flow control. Further enhancements can be made by incorporating advanced 
NLP libraries, implementing context awareness, and expanding the chatbot's knowledge base. Experimentation and customization are 
encouraged to tailor the chatbot to specific use cases and improve its user engagement capabiliti
